Ror Xmonand running on Ubuntu 1.04 running on a VM

__credits:__ Altered from George's awesome dotfiles on the BUILDS wiki, installed using some scripts provided by some gentleman on the internet [[https://github.com/davidbrewer/xmonad-ubuntu-conf]]

### ~/.xmonad

#### start-xmondad
Altered version of davidbrewers start-xmonad. Runs at login. 

- Replaced stalonetray with trayer
- loads penguin backgroudn from ~/pictures file

#### xmobarrc
Exact version of davidbrewers xmobarrc?? I think that I don't run this, and replaced ~/.xmobarr with George's or Ted's

#### xmonad.hs
Altered version of George's xmonad.hs

- _NOTE:_ this loads `xfce4-terminal`. Need to apt-get install xfce4-terminal? before running?

### ~/

#### .xmobarrc
George's `.xmobarrc`, the xmobarrc that should actually be used

#### .emacs
My sparce .emacs! mostly for orgmode <3<3.  A few commented out lines to get slightly better colors when using emacs in macosx 

#### .bashrc
bashrc

## ~/.config/Terminal/
